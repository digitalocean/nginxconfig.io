<!-- Fill out the template. Don't write inside the arrows as they will be hidden
when you post your issue.

If you have a feature suggestion for the tool, read through the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template.
      This will help us understand what you're requesting and why you want us
      to add it.

2.  Keep it simple.
      Make sure it's easy to understand what you're requesting. A good way is
      to keep it to one request per GitHub issue, as we can then easily track
      feature requests.

3.  Check whether it has already been asked or added.
      You can search the exiting GitHub issues to see if your feature has
      already been requested.

4.  Ask yourself: "Does this idea/feature belong as part of the tool?"
      Whilst we'd love to be able to add every feature that every user wants,
      we want to keep the site as small and as fast as possible by limiting how
      much code we have. Make sure the feature you are requesting is something
      that others will benefit from, not just you.

5.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue! -->
